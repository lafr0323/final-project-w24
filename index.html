            <div class="wrapper split1">
            <p>Here's the scoop from Doughp's founder on how this flavor came to be: "I first made Red 
                Velvet on a total whim, just a few months into business in 2017. One day, while mixing up 
                Doughp at our original commercial kitchen in Oakland, I left to grab some lunch at a 
                nearby bakery.</p>

                <p>I saw an absolutely delicious-looking red velvet cake in their dessert case and 
                immediately thought: I NEED to know what this tastes like in cookie dough! I bought the 
                cake and mixed it 
                right into a small 5lb batch of Doughp; cream cheese frosting, cake and all! HEAVEN by the 
                spoonful!"</p>
